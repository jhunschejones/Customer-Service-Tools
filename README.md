# Customer Service Tools

This repositiory is for a collection of basic web apps I’ve built for the call center customer service team at my current workplace. I used Bootstrap 4 and JavaScript to spin these up, origionally in less than a day apiece, and I am very proud of the results.
  
The most challenging yet exciting part of this project has been interacting directly with my users. Through this experience, I have been able to make several significant improvements to different elements of the application. It has been incredible to see how much even a fairly basic app can make someone’s job easier, and I am inspired to do more work like this in the future!
  
### Thanks
I want to say a special thank you to my co-workers, and the customer service representatives who tested these applications and provided quality feedback. You guys are all great teammates!
