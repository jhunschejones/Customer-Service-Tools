# Customer Service Tools

This is a small collection of basic web apps I’ve built for the call center customer service team at my workplace. I used Bootstrap 4 and JavaScript to spin these up in less than a day apiece, and I am very proud of the results.
  
The most challenging yet exciting part of this project was having the opportunity to interact directly with my users. Through this experience, I was able to make several improvements to the program. It was incredible to see how much even a small application can make someone’s job easier and I am inspired to do more work like this in the future!
  
I want to say a special thanks to my co-workers, and the customer service representatives who tested these applications and provided quality feedback. You guys are all great teammates!
