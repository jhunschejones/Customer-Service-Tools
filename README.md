# Customer Service Tools

This repositiory is for a collection of basic web apps and SQL templates I’ve built for the call center customer service team at my current workplace. 
  
The most exciting and challenging part of this project has been interacting directly with my users. Through this experience, I have been able to make several significant improvements to different elements of the application. It has been incredible to see how much even a fairly basic app can make someone’s job easier, and I am inspired to do more work like this in the future! If you have questions or feedback on these apps, or would simply like to get in touch, can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jhunschejones), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jhunschejones), or by [email](mailto:contact@joshuahunschejones.com).
