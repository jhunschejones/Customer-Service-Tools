# Call Flow Progress 

## Objective
I wanted to build a simple browser-based application that a health care customer service representative could use to track their progress through a benefit quote on a phone call.

## Steps Taken
I used the Bootstrap 4 framework for the heading and list items, then a progress bar from W3 schools. In order to have the different list items change color when clicked, I had to write my own JavaScript file. Once I was able to get the list items to change colors, I also built an event listener and an additional JavaScript function to change the style of the progress bar and it's text as the list items are clicked by the user.
  
After doing some user testing, there was a request to add an 8th list item. I added this list item and updated the program for all users. Another request was submitted to make a version of the application that uses check boxes so that users could go in their own order instead of just sequentially. This update has been completed in a separate "checks.html" file so that both versions are available. I had to re-write my JavaScript file as well to accommodate the new user input, this is stored as script2.js. I am especially proud of how responsive the new scripting is, updating the progress bar actively while the user is checking and/or unchecking boxes.

## Results
The final application is clean and basic and meets all the requirements set at the start of the project. I was able to get it running in Chrome, so I did my first set of user tests there. After implementing the additional features requested, I was also able to find a head meta tag that would enable me to require Edge mode in IE. This solved my IE compatibility issues on the platforms where I tested. I want to say a special thanks to my coworkers and the users who suggested improvements for this program. You all made this an even more helpful tool for our new team members.
