# Claim Flow

## Objectives
Create a basic web app that can function as a reference tool for customer service reps reviewing medical claims.

## Steps Taken
I used the Bootstrap 4 framework and constructed the heading, buttons, and collapsible content. During the planning phase, I tested another version of the app that displayed images for each category. After completing the first prototype with this functionality I had another trainer test the content. With the changing images, the interface of the app was becoming too cluttered and distracting. I went back to the drawing board with the help of my teammates and decided on the simpler collapsing interface seen in the final application.

## Results
I am proud of the clean look of this app and some of the small extra features that might not stick out at first glance. I used pop-overs for a couple areas of additional content, and badges to indicate how many bullets of information were under each topic. Future improvements might include adding additional content and pop-overs or links to direct users to additional resources.
