# SQL Query Templates
These templates were created during my role as a Training and Quality Assurance Coordinator at Providence Health Plan. In order to keep our training materials up to date, we need frequently needed to get new example members and claims. The fastest way to do this in large volumes was to query our claims and member tables. I have included snippets here of some of the main functionality of these templates. You may notice there are portions left out, particularly those involved in creating the temporary results tables, and that is because these have confidential business information. I have trained several coworkers how to use these templates in SQL Server Management Studio (first in the 2008 version, then 2014) and they function well when a user just comments out the WHERE statements they don't need to use. Over the months since these were created I have worked with my team to add more functionality to the templates as we encountered more scenarios where we wanted to use them. The clips you see here also reflect much of that collaboration and I found the process of meeting with end-users to find out what they wanted in a piece of code incredibly engaging.
